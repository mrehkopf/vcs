## Features

- Various feature and usability improvements over Datapath's default capture application to maximize capture quality
- Unlimited video presets with programmable activation
- Several scaling modes and image filters
- Variable refresh rate output to match the input
- Works with modern and legacy VisionRGB hardware
- Free and open source

## Supported capture hardware

VCS is compatible with at least the following Datapath capture cards:

- VisionRGB-PRO1
- VisionRGB-PRO2
- VisionRGB-E1
- VisionRGB-E2
- VisionRGB-E1S
- VisionRGB-E2S
- VisionRGB-X2

## Building

Run `$ qmake && make` in the repo's root; or open [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) in Qt Creator. You may need to modify some of the include paths in [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) to match your system.

### Dependencies

The VCS codebase depends on the following third-party libraries and frameworks:

1. Qt 5
2. OpenCV 3.2.0*
3. The Datapath capture API, as distributed with their Linux capture drivers**

\* Later versions of OpenCV may also work. See [this issue](https://github.com/leikareipa/vcs/issues/30) for details.\
\** Only needed if compiling for Datapath hardware, which is the default option. See [The capture backend](#the-capture-backend) for details.

I use the following toolchains when developing VCS:

| OS      | Compiler           | Qt   | OpenCV |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---- | ------ |
| Linux   | GCC 9.4 (64-bit)   | 5.12 | 3.2.0  |

### Release build vs. debug build

The default configuration in [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) produces a debug build, with &ndash; among other things &ndash; more copious run-time bounds-checking of memory accesses. The run-time debugging features are expected to reduce performance to some extent, but can help reveal programming errors.

Defining `RELEASE_BUILD` globally will produce a release build, with fewer debugging checks in performance-critical sections of the program. Simply uncomment `DEFINES += RELEASE_BUILD` at the top of [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) and execute a full rebuild.

To confirm whether the program is running in release or debug mode, check the About dialog (right-click VCS's output window and select "About VCS&hellip;"). For debug builds, the program's version will be reported as "VCS x.x.x (non-release build)", whereas for release builds it'll be "VCS x.x.x".

### The capture backend

A capture backend in VCS is an implementation providing support for a particular capture device. For example, Datapath's VisionRGB capture cards are supported in VCS on Linux by the [Vision capture backend](./src/capture/vision_v4l/).

One (and only one) capture backend must be active in any build of VCS. To select which one it is, set its identifier in the `DEFINES` variable in [vcs.pro](vcs.pro).

The following capture backends are available:

| Identifier                  | Explanation |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| CAPTURE_BACKEND_VISION_V4L  | Supports the Datapath VisionRGB range of capture cards on Linux. Requires [Datapath's Linux Vision driver](https://www.datapathsoftware.com/vision-capture-card-downloads/vision-drivers/vision-drivers-1) to be installed on the system (and re-installed whenever the kernel is updated). |
| CAPTURE_BACKEND_VIRTUAL     | Provides a device-independent capture source that generates a test image. Useful for debugging, and doesn't require a capture device or its drivers to be installed. |
| CAPTURE_BACKEND_DOSBOX_MMAP | Allows capturing DOSBox's frame buffer on Linux. Intended for debugging. See [this blog post](https://www.tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/blog/capturing-dosboxs-frame-buffer-via-shared-memory/) for details.|

## Program flow

VCS is a mostly single-threaded application whose event loop is synchronized to the capture device's rate of output. In general, VCS's main loop polls the capture device until a capture event (e.g. new frame) occurs, then processes the event, and returns to the polling loop.

![](./images/diagrams/code-flow.png)

 The above diagram shows a general step-by-step view of VCS's program flow. `Capture` communicates with the capture device (which will typically be running in its own thread), receiving frame data and setting hardware-side capture parameters. `Main` polls `Capture` to receive information about capture events. When it receives a new frame from `Capture`, `Main` sends the frame's data to `Scale` for scaling, which then forwards it to `Filter` for image filtering, which in turn sends it to `Display` to be rendered onto VCS's output window.

| System  | Corresponding source code          |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Main    | [src/main.cpp](./src/main.cpp)     |
| Capture | [src/capture/*](./src/capture/)    |
| Scale   | [src/scaler/*](./src/scaler/)      |
| Filter  | [src/filter/*](./src/filter/)      |
| Display | [src/display/*](./src/display/)    |
