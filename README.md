## Features

- Various feature and usability improvements over Datapath's default capture application to maximize capture quality
- Unlimited video presets with programmable activation
- Several scaling modes and image filters
- Variable refresh rate output to match the input
- Works with modern and legacy VisionRGB hardware
- Free and open source

## Supported capture hardware

VCS is compatible with at least the following Datapath capture cards:

- VisionRGB-PRO1
- VisionRGB-PRO2
- VisionRGB-E1
- VisionRGB-E2
- VisionRGB-E1S
- VisionRGB-E2S
- VisionRGB-X2

## Building

Open [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) in Qt Creator, or run `$ qmake && make -j` in the repo's root. You'll need to meet the [dependencies](#dependencies), and may need to modify some of the `INCLUDEPATH` entries in [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) to match your system.

### Dependencies

The VCS codebase depends on the following libraries and frameworks:

1. Qt 5
2. OpenCV*
3. If compiling for X11, libx11-dev
4. The Datapath capture API, as distributed with their Linux capture drivers**
5. Non-release builds*** are configured to use AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, which should come pre-installed with your compiler on common platforms. For these builds, you'll need to create a file called **asan-suppress.txt** in the directory of the VCS executable, and either leave it blank, or populate it according to [this guide](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerLeakSanitizer#suppressions) to have AddressSanitizer ignore leaks in external code (e.g. third-party libraries).

\* I use OpenCV 3.2.0, but later versions may also be compatible. See [this issue](https://github.com/leikareipa/vcs/issues/30) for details.\
\** Only needed if compiling for Datapath hardware, which is the default option. See [The capture backend](#the-capture-backend) for details.\
\*** See [Release build vs. debug build](#release-build-vs-debug-build).

I use the following toolchains when developing VCS:

| OS                 | Compiler           | Qt   | OpenCV | Capture card           |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ---- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Ubuntu 20.04 HWE   | GCC 9.4 (64-bit)   | 5.12 | 3.2.0  | Datapath VisionRGB-E1S |

### Release build vs. debug build

The default configuration in [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) produces a debug build, which has &ndash; among other things &ndash; more copious run-time bounds-checking of memory accesses. The run-time debugging features are expected to reduce performance to some extent, but can help reveal programming errors.

Defining `VCS_RELEASE_BUILD` globally will produce a release build, with fewer debugging checks in performance-critical sections of the program. Simply uncomment `DEFINES += VCS_RELEASE_BUILD` at the top of [vcs.pro](vcs.pro) and do a full rebuild.

To confirm whether the program is running in release or debug mode, check the About dialog (right-click VCS's output window and select "About VCS&hellip;"). For debug builds, the program's version will be reported as "VCS x.x.x (non-release build)", whereas for release builds it'll be "VCS x.x.x".

### The capture backend

A capture backend in VCS is an implementation providing support for a particular capture device. For example, Datapath's VisionRGB capture cards are supported in VCS on Linux by the [Vision capture backend](./src/capture/vision_v4l/).

One (and only one) capture backend must be active in any build of VCS. To select which one it is, set its identifier in the `DEFINES` variable in [vcs.pro](vcs.pro).

The following capture backends are available:

| Identifier                  | Explanation |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| CAPTURE_BACKEND_VISION_V4L  | Supports the Datapath VisionRGB range of capture cards on Linux. Requires [Datapath's Linux Vision driver](https://www.datapathsoftware.com/vision-capture-card-downloads/vision-drivers/vision-drivers-1) to be installed on the system (and re-installed whenever the kernel is updated). |
| CAPTURE_BACKEND_VIRTUAL     | Provides a device-independent capture source that generates a test image. Useful for debugging, and doesn't require a capture device or its drivers to be installed. |
| CAPTURE_BACKEND_DOSBOX_MMAP | Allows capturing DOSBox's frame buffer on Linux. Intended for debugging. See [this blog post](https://www.tarpeeksihyvaesoft.com/blog/capturing-dosboxs-frame-buffer-via-shared-memory/) for details.|
