 * @brief
 * The capture subsystem interface.
 *
 * The capture subsystem is responsible for mediating exchange between VCS and
 * the capture device; including initializing the device and providing VCS with
 * access to the frame buffer(s) associated with the device.
 * 
 * The capture subsystem is an exceptional subsystem in that it's allowed to run
 * outside of the main VCS thread. This freedom -- in what is otherwise a
 * single-threaded application -- is granted because some capture devices require
 * out-of-thread callbacks or the like.
 * 
 * The multithreaded capture subsystem will typically have an idle monitoring
 * thread that waits for the capture device to send in data. When data comes in,
 * the thread will copy it to a local memory buffer to be operated on in the
 * main VCS thread when it's ready to do so.
 * 
 * Because of the out-of-thread nature of this subsystem, it's important that
 * accesses to its memory buffers are synchronized using the capture mutex (see
 * kc_capture_mutex()).
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 *   1. Call kc_initialize_capture() to initialize the subsystem. This is VCS's
 *      default startup behavior.
 *
 *   2. Use the interface functions to interact with the subsystem. For instance,
 *      kc_get_frame_buffer() returns the most recent captured frame's data.
 *
 *   3. Call kc_release_capture() to release the subsystem. This is VCS's default
 *      exit behavior.
 * 
 * ## Implementing support for new capture devices
 * 
 * The capture subsystem interface provides a declaration of the functions used
 * by VCS to interact with the capture subsystem. Some of the functions -- e.g.
 * kc_initialize_capture() -- are agnostic to the capture device being used, while
 * others -- e.g. kc_initialize_device() -- are specific to a particular type of
 * capture device.
 * 
 * The universal functions like kc_initialize_capture() are defined in the
 * base interface source file (@a capture.cpp), whereas the device-specific
 * functions like kc_initialize_device() are implemented in a separate,
 * device-specific source file. For instance, the device source file
 * @a capture_rgbeasy.cpp implements support for RGBEasy capture devices under
 * Windows, while @a capture_vision_v4l.cpp adds support for Vision Linux devices.
 * Both files simply implement the device-specific functions of the interface for
 * the corresponding device, and depending on which device is to be supported by
 * VCS, only one of the files gets included in the compiled executable (see @a vcs.pro
 * for the logic that decides which implementation is included in the build).
 * 
 * You can add support for a new capture device by creating implementations for
 * the device of all of the device-specific interface functions, namely those
 * declared in capture.h prefixed with @a kc_ but which aren't already defined in
 * @a capture.cpp. You can look at the existing device source files for hands-on
 * examples.
 * 
 * As you'll see from @a capture_virtual.cpp, the capture device doesn't need
 * to be an actual device. It can be any source of image data -- something
 * that reads images from @a stdin, for example. It only needs to implement the
 * interface functions and to output its data in the form dictated by the interface.
